# JSON IoT Server

## JITS Server

### Concepts

#### Client
The client is a hardware/software that reads data from sensors and send it to the server.

In your server you can define what data to use and how do you see it.

#### View
A view is a virtual client that can combine more than one client.

Is good if you want to see all the temperature values from your clients.

#### Alarm
An alarm can be setted for the user to be aware of a particular scenario.

For instance, the temperature is higher than 25ÂºC.
